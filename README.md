# UserAnalytics
The program is designed to collect user statistics on sites for Neosyntez.
First, the program receives raw data from the database. 
Then the data is processed. After that, they are published to the site via the API. 
At the same time, a dashboard in Excel format for the project manager is created based on the received data.
